At Mothership we strongly feel that good design and polished UI/UX is just as important as the service
offered. We are not content with business and enterprise software being subpar to their consumer
counterparts. As a senior react engineer at Mothership you will be responsible for creating a unique and
personalized site and app experience for our customers. We have developed this programming challenge to
help better gauge your coding abilities in the following fields:

- React
- Redux
- React Router v4
- Styling
- API Requests

The Project:
Please create a new react app and implement the design located in the Sketch file below. From Sketch
you can export any of the assets you may need (icons... etc). Please adhere strictly to the design - you will be
graded partially on your ability to push a pixel perfect project. As far as implementation, we are being
purposefully vague as to see how you can interpret the design in the cleanest and most optimal fashion. The
following endpoints are available for your use (please use userId u2kjfladadwddj9​).

GET https://challenge.mothership.com/user/:userId

GET https://challenge.mothership.com/organization/:organizationId/billing

The Design (Sketch File):

Requirements:
You must use the latest version of react, redux, react router v4 and axios for your network calls. You
must fetch the initial user into the redux state, and from there, continue on to receive the organization’s billing
information. The more reusable and modular your implementation, the better.

Extra Credit:
Bonus points will be applied if you use redux-saga for your asynchronous actions, styled-components
and/or react-loadable.
