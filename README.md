A programming challenge I completed to demonstate coding abilities in the following fields:

- React
- Redux
- React Router v4
- Styling
- API Requests

The Project:
Create a new react app and implement a provided Sketch file design, export any assets needed (icons... etc) and adhere strictly to the design interpret it in the cleanest and most optimal fashion. Use the following endpoints (userId u2kjfladadwddj9).

GET https://challenge.mothership.com/user/:userId

GET https://challenge.mothership.com/organization/:organizationId/billing

The Design (Sketch File):
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j8-s3oovgAt6-ySTclO9Qce4MYVXbTYE/view

Requirements:
Use the latest version of react, redux, react router v4 and axios for network calls. Fetch the initial user into the redux state, and from there, continue on to receive the organizationâ€™s billing information. The more reusable and modular your implementation, the better.

Extra Credit:
Use redux-saga for your asynchronous actions, styled-components and/or react-loadable.
